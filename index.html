<p>Hello and welcome to my webpage! I am a fairy who is best friends with Peter Pan. Also known
as the boy who won't grow up. I mean, come on already, we get it.
Anyway I'm pretty sassy and always want my way, but I rarely get it.
</p>
<br>
<p>I am usually seen with my hair up in a bun, my green dress on, and my wigs flittering around. But what I 
really like to do in my free time is dress is go to drag shows. I also really like to dress up and have this really awesome red wig and many many dresses.
I'm also a really good beat boxer.
